# Turbin3 SVM Q1
My repo for Q1 Turbin3 SVM
## Prereq Questions
*The answers to the prerequisite questions may be modified and further completed before January 12.*

### Q: Based on your review of **SolanaHowitWorks** and any other documentation, describe what is happening in the area you plan to focus on.
**A:**  I plan to focus on the SVM API. The SVM API is a set of components, decoupled from a validator, responsible for processing transactions. The SVM loads program accounts, verifies their validity, creates an invocation context, and executes the transaction instructions via the RBPF (Berkeley Packet Filter Runtime)..


### Q: Go to the Anza Agave Client Repository - copy 20-30 lines of code from the area you are focusing on - annotate the code by noting: 
1. What is the rust concept
2. What is it doing? 
3. How can it be made better? 


```rust
#[cfg_attr(feature = "frozen-abi", derive(AbiExample))]
#[cfg_attr(
    feature = "dev-context-only-utils",
    field_qualifiers(slot(pub), epoch(pub))
)]
/// This struct is used for managing a batch of transactions. 
/// It encapsulates multiple components and information needed 
/// to execute transactions in a blockchain context.
pub struct TransactionBatchProcessor<FG: ForkGraph> {
    /// Bank slot (i.e: block).
    slot: Slot,

    ///Bank epoch. An epoch is a group of slots used
    /// for higher-level org, 
    /// typically staking or consensus mechanisms.
    epoch: Epoch,

    /// A thread-safe cache for (sysvars). These variables 
    /// provide important data (e.g., clock, rent, stake history) accessible 
    /// from on-chain programs. The cache ensures that this data is efficiently
    /// shared across threads and passed to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).
    sysvar_cache: RwLock<SysvarCache>,

    /// A thread-safe, shareable cache of programs required for processing 
    /// transaction batches. This helps optimize transaction execution by 
    /// storing program metadata or compiled binaries for reuse.
    pub program_cache: Arc<RwLock<ProgramCache<FG>>>,

    /// A thread-safe collection of program IDs for built-in (native) programs. 
    /// These are foundational programs included in the blockchain runtime, 
    /// such as the system program, vote program, or stake program.
    pub builtin_program_ids: RwLock<HashSet<Pubkey>>,
}

impl<FG: ForkGraph> Debug for TransactionBatchProcessor<FG> {
    /// Implements the `Debug` trait to provide a custom debug string representation 
    /// of the `TransactionBatchProcessor` struct. This is useful for logging 
    /// or debugging purposes.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        // Create a debug representation of the struct and include relevant fields.
        f.debug_struct("TransactionBatchProcessor")
            .field("slot", &self.slot) // Adds the slot field to the debug output.
            .field("epoch", &self.epoch) // Adds the epoch field to the debug output.
            .field("sysvar_cache", &self.sysvar_cache) // Adds the sysvar_cache field to the debug output.
            .field("program_cache", &self.program_cache) // Adds the program_cache field to the debug output.
            .finish() // Finalizes the debug struct.
    }
}
```
3. How can it be made better? 

**A:** From a higher perspective: it would be interesting to see how to use the SVM API for different things, such as rollups for example.

### Q: Are you familiar with various benchmark testing practices? If so, what have you done? If not, do some research and note what you want to learn more about. 

**A:** I am not familiar with it, but I would like to learn more about benchmark testing in terms of TPS and latency.
