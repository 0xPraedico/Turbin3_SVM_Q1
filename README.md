# ZkSVM Rollup Prototype

We built a prototype of a ZkSVM rollup as a team using [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) by Succinct.

As part of this project, we also explored mechanisms for integrating Merkle trees to manage and verify state transitions efficiently within the rollup architecture.
