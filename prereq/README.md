# Prereq Questions
*The answers to the prerequisite questions may be modified and further completed before January 12.*

### Q: Based on your review of **SolanaHowitWorks** and any other documentation, describe what is happening in the area you plan to focus on.
**A:**  I plan to focus on the SVM API. The SVM API is a set of components, decoupled from a validator, responsible for processing transactions. The SVM loads program accounts, verifies their validity, creates an invocation context, and executes the transaction instructions via the RBPF (Berkeley Packet Filter Runtime)..


### Q: Go to the Anza Agave Client Repository - copy 20-30 lines of code from the area you are focusing on - annotate the code by noting: 
1. What is the rust concept
2. What is it doing? 
3. How can it be made better? 


```rust
#[cfg_attr(feature = "frozen-abi", derive(AbiExample))]
#[cfg_attr(
    feature = "dev-context-only-utils",
    field_qualifiers(slot(pub), epoch(pub))
)]
/// This struct is used for managing a batch of transactions. 
/// It encapsulates multiple components and information needed 
/// to execute transactions in a blockchain context.
pub struct TransactionBatchProcessor<FG: ForkGraph> {
    /// Bank slot (i.e: block).
    slot: Slot,

    ///Bank epoch. An epoch is a group of slots used
    /// for higher-level org, 
    /// typically staking or consensus mechanisms.
    epoch: Epoch,

    /// A thread-safe cache for (sysvars). These variables 
    /// provide important data (e.g., clock, rent, stake history) accessible 
    /// from on-chain programs. The cache ensures that this data is efficiently
    /// shared across threads and passed to the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).
    sysvar_cache: RwLock<SysvarCache>,

    /// A thread-safe, shareable cache of programs required for processing 
    /// transaction batches. This helps optimize transaction execution by 
    /// storing program metadata or compiled binaries for reuse.
    pub program_cache: Arc<RwLock<ProgramCache<FG>>>,

    /// A thread-safe collection of program IDs for built-in (native) programs. 
    /// These are foundational programs included in the blockchain runtime
    pub builtin_program_ids: RwLock<HashSet<Pubkey>>,
}

impl<FG: ForkGraph> Debug for TransactionBatchProcessor<FG> {
    /// Implements the `Debug` trait to provide a custom debug string representation 
    /// of the `TransactionBatchProcessor` struct. This is useful for logging 
    /// or debugging purposes.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> std::fmt::Result {
        // Create a debug representation of the struct and include relevant fields.
        f.debug_struct("TransactionBatchProcessor")
            .field("slot", &self.slot) // Adds the slot field to the debug output.
            .field("epoch", &self.epoch) // Adds the epoch field to the debug output.
            .field("sysvar_cache", &self.sysvar_cache) // Adds the sysvar_cache field to the debug output.
            .field("program_cache", &self.program_cache) // Adds the program_cache field to the debug output.
            .finish() // Finalizes the debug struct.
    }
}
impl<FG: ForkGraph> Default for TransactionBatchProcessor<FG> {
    /// Implements the `Default` trait to provide a default instance of
    /// `TransactionBatchProcessor`. This is useful when a fully initialized
    /// instance isn't required, or as a placeholder for testing.
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            // Sets the `slot` field to its default value. This represents the current
            // block number being processed, defaulting to the initial slot.
            slot: Slot::default(),

            // Sets the `epoch` field to its default value. Epochs are groups of slots,
            // used for higher-level organization such as staking and consensus.
            epoch: Epoch::default(),

            // Initializes the `sysvar_cache` field with a default instance of `SysvarCache`
            // wrapped in a thread-safe `RwLock`. This ensures sysvar data can be accessed
            // safely and concurrently.
            sysvar_cache: RwLock::<SysvarCache>::default(),

            // Initializes the `program_cache` field with a default `ProgramCache`
            // wrapped in an `Arc` and `RwLock`. This enables sharing program data
            // between threads, while ensuring mutable access when needed.
            program_cache: Arc::new(RwLock::new(ProgramCache::new(
                Slot::default(), // Default slot for the cache.
                Epoch::default(), // Default epoch for the cache.
            ))),

            // Initializes the `builtin_program_ids` field as an empty `HashSet`
            // wrapped in a thread-safe `RwLock`. This will hold the IDs of
            // built-in programs required for execution.
            builtin_program_ids: RwLock::new(HashSet::new()),
        }
    }
}
```
3. How can it be made better? 

**A:** From a higher perspective: it would be interesting to see how to use the SVM API for different things, such as rollups for example.

### Q: Are you familiar with various benchmark testing practices? If so, what have you done? If not, do some research and note what you want to learn more about. 

**A:** I am not familiar with it, but I would like to learn more about benchmark testing in terms of TPS and latency.
