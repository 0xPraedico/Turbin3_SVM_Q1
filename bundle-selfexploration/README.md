# Exploring Transaction Bundles for SVM Rollups
## Description
Transaction bundles have been a key factor in the success of Solana. Beyond their well-documented role in MEV, they enable the creation of DeFi applications that require atomicity and sequential execution of transactions. In this context, the success of SVM-based projects depends on implementing similar mechanisms.

This repository is dedicated to exploring transaction bundling on Solana, taking inspiration from the Jito transaction bundling mechanism.

The goal of this exploration is to self-study and document Jitoâ€™s bundling implementation and mechanisms while assessing the feasibility of adapting similar functionality for an SVM-based rollup.
